tool: climate_maladaptation
type: friction
domain: climate

selection:
  use_when:
    - "A proposed climate intervention may solve one layer while harming another (maladaptation risk)."
    - "Infrastructure-heavy plan risks ecological collapse or policy blowback."
    - "Short-term atmospheric gains without governance/ecological safeguards."
  not_for:
    - "Pure emissions accounting without intervention tradeoffs."
    - "Local weather forecasts (not an intervention design tool)."

parameters:
  atmospheric:
    layer: Micro
    low: "Limited direct atmospheric benefit"
    mid: "Moderate atmospheric impact"
    high: "Strong short-term atmospheric effect"
  ecological:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Ecosystem stress; low resilience"
    mid: "Mixed ecological response"
    high: "Ecosystem benefits; high resilience"
  infrastructure:
    layer: Macro
    low: "Weak infrastructure fit"
    mid: "Moderate resilience/fit"
    high: "Strong infrastructure resilience/benefit"
  policy:
    layer: Meta
    low: "Low policy coherence/legitimacy"
    mid: "Partial alignment"
    high: "Strong governance alignment and enforceability"

interaction_guidance:
  modes:
    base: "Fixed I for comparability across interventions."
    dynamic: "Default; dynamic I equals base (no hidden interaction logic)."
    override: "Use when one layer's evidence quality differs materially."
  override_mode_defaults:
    override_mode: scale
    rationale: "Scale confidence rather than re-weighting theory (W is immutable)."
  dampen_when:
    atmospheric: "Atmospheric benefit claim is model-only with weak validation."
    infrastructure: "Resilience estimates are speculative or vendor-driven."
  amplify_when:
    ecological: "Ecological impact is supported by field data and monitoring."
    policy: "Policy support is durable (multi-stakeholder, funded, enforceable)."
  examples:
    - scenario: "Big infrastructure project with weak ecological monitoring"
      interaction_mode: dynamic
      interaction_override: {infrastructure: 0.8, ecological: 1.2}
      interaction_override_mode: scale
      rationale: "Dampen speculative infra optimism; amplify well-evidenced ecological constraints."

interpretation:
  high_m: "Friction: maladaptation risk; cross-layer harms likely without redesign."
  low_m: "Lower maladaptation tension; intervention is more balanced."
  check:
    - "Infra >> eco is a classic maladaptation signature."
    - "Low policy coherence can turn a technical win into a long-term loss."

iteration:
  note: "Coupling is based on L only; use I to encode confidence and compare m_score/attribution/visibility."

tool: military_friction_forecast
type: friction
domain: military

selection:
  use_when:
    - "Tactical plan may fail due to logistics or political constraints."
    - "You need to identify the bottleneck layer (maneuver/intel/sustainment/political)."
    - "Assess readiness mismatch between tactical and support layers."
  not_for:
    - "Detailed operational planning or force employment."
    - "Questions without quantified readiness estimates."

parameters:
  maneuver:
    layer: Micro
    low: "Limited maneuver options; constrained"
    mid: "Some maneuver flexibility"
    high: "High maneuver feasibility"
  intelligence:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Low confidence / high uncertainty"
    mid: "Partial situational awareness"
    high: "High intel confidence"
  sustainment:
    layer: Macro
    low: "Logistics fragile"
    mid: "Sustainment adequate with risk"
    high: "Sustainment robust"
  political:
    layer: Meta
    low: "Authorization unclear/fragile"
    mid: "Mixed political constraints"
    high: "Clear durable authorization"

interaction_guidance:
  modes:
    base: "Fixed I for comparability across assessments."
    dynamic: "Default; dynamic I equals base (no hidden interaction logic)."
    override: "Use to encode confidence in estimates (intel often uncertain)."
  override_mode_defaults:
    override_mode: scale
    rationale: "Dampen uncertain estimates rather than forcing a decision."
  dampen_when:
    intelligence: "Intel inputs are stale, single-source, or contested."
    political: "Political authorization is volatile or conditional."
  amplify_when:
    sustainment: "Logistics data is measured and current (fuel, spares, lift)."
    maneuver: "Terrain/enemy disposition well-characterized."
  examples:
    - scenario: "Intel uncertain; sustainment clearly constrained"
      interaction_mode: dynamic
      interaction_override: {intelligence: 0.8, sustainment: 1.2}
      interaction_override_mode: scale
      rationale: "Discount uncertainty; emphasize hard logistics limits."

interpretation:
  high_m: "Friction: readiness mismatch; bottleneck likely determines outcome."
  low_m: "Less friction; readiness across layers is more coherent."
  check:
    - "Bottleneck layer is usually the minimum of L (or the largest readiness gap)."

iteration:
  note: "Coupling is based on L only; use I to encode confidence and compare m_score/attribution/visibility."

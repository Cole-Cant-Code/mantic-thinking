tool: system_lock_recursive_control
type: friction
domain: system_lock

selection:
  use_when:
    - "Platform lock-in is suspected and control may be outpacing user agency."
    - "Interventions appear to be absorbed into system-preserving behavior."
    - "You need a structured read on value asymmetry and recursive control depth."
  not_for:
    - "Simple competition analysis without recursive lock dynamics."
    - "Short-lived spikes in dominance that do not indicate structural lock."

parameters:
  agent_autonomy:
    layer: Micro
    low: "Users constrained to low-agency, algorithm-shaped defaults"
    mid: "Moderate awareness with partial choice diversity"
    high: "Strong user agency and meaningful choice control"
  collective_capacity:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Alternatives fragmented and non-viable"
    mid: "Alternatives emerging with uneven traction"
    high: "Alternatives coordinated, viable, and scaling"
  concentration_control:
    layer: Macro
    low: "Low concentration and distributed value capture"
    mid: "Moderate concentration with growing control leverage"
    high: "High concentration with structural control power"
  recursive_depth:
    layer: Meta
    low: "Shallow patterns; interventions can hold"
    mid: "Recursive reinforcement present; interventions partially absorbed"
    high: "Deep recursion; interventions systematically absorbed"

interaction_guidance:
  modes:
    base: "Use fixed I for baseline comparability."
    dynamic: "Default; recursive_depth is amplified when concentration_control exceeds agent_autonomy."
    override: "Use for scenario stress tests and confidence tuning."
  key_dynamic: "Lock amplification captures the concentration-over-agency feedback loop."

interpretation:
  high_m: "Friction: lock dynamics are active; asymmetry and recursion are reinforcing each other."
  low_m: "Lower lock tension: system remains flexible enough for direct interventions."
  check:
    - "High concentration_control + high recursive_depth with low autonomy is the canonical lock signature."

iteration:
  note: "Use memory kernel to probe intervention absorption and compare attribution shifts under dynamic vs base interaction mode."

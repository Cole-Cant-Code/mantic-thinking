tool: cyber_attribution_resolver
type: friction
domain: cyber

selection:
  use_when:
    - "Technical sophistication and geopolitical context disagree (attribution uncertainty)."
    - "Threat intel confidence is low relative to observed capability (false flag / unknown actor)."
    - "High impact incident with weak corroboration on actor/motive."
  not_for:
    - "Basic vulnerability remediation without attribution questions."
    - "Pure incident response runbooks (no cross-signal mismatch)."

parameters:
  technical:
    layer: Micro
    low: "Commodity tooling; low sophistication"
    mid: "Mixed TTPs; moderate capability"
    high: "Advanced tradecraft; high sophistication"
  threat_intel:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Sparse/uncorroborated intel"
    mid: "Partial attribution indicators"
    high: "Strong corroboration across sources"
  operational_impact:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Limited impact; contained"
    mid: "Meaningful disruption"
    high: "Severe impact; systemic risk"
  geopolitical:
    layer: Macro
    low: "Low motive/context alignment"
    mid: "Ambiguous context"
    high: "Strong motive/context alignment"

interaction_guidance:
  modes:
    base: "Fixed I for consistent comparisons across incidents."
    dynamic: "Default; dynamic I equals base (no hidden interaction logic)."
    override: "Use to dampen untrusted intel feeds or amplify validated signals."
  override_mode_defaults:
    override_mode: scale
    rationale: "Scale confidence without changing the tool's mismatch logic."
  dampen_when:
    threat_intel: "Intel is single-source, politically motivated, or outdated."
    geopolitical: "Context is speculative or driven by narrative rather than evidence."
  amplify_when:
    technical: "Multiple artifacts confirm sophistication (malware + infra + ops)."
    operational_impact: "Impact data is well-measured (scope, dwell time, blast radius)."
  examples:
    - scenario: "High sophistication artifacts; intel feed unreliable"
      interaction_mode: dynamic
      interaction_override: {technical: 1.2, threat_intel: 0.7}
      interaction_override_mode: scale
      rationale: "Trust artifacts more than weak intel; reflect uncertainty in attribution."

interpretation:
  high_m: "Friction: attribution gap; capability/context/intel disagree."
  low_m: "Signals align; attribution picture is more coherent."
  check:
    - "High technical + low intel often implies unknown actor or deception."
    - "High geo context + low technical can imply proxy activity or misattribution."

iteration:
  note: "Coupling is based on L only; use I to encode confidence and compare m_score/attribution/visibility."

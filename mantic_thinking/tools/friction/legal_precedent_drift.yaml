tool: legal_precedent_drift
type: friction
domain: legal

selection:
  use_when:
    - "Statutory text, precedent stability, operational feasibility, and socio-political climate are diverging."
    - "You suspect judicial philosophy shift threatens precedent-based strategy."
    - "Forum selection or litigation posture depends on drift risk."
  not_for:
    - "Simple contract interpretation without systemic drift concerns."
    - "Giving legal advice for a specific jurisdiction without inputs."

parameters:
  black_letter:
    layer: Micro
    low: "Weak statutory text support"
    mid: "Ambiguous text support"
    high: "Strong textual support"
  precedent:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Precedent unstable/contested"
    mid: "Mixed precedent landscape"
    high: "Precedent strong and consistent"
  operational:
    layer: Macro
    low: "Hard to implement/enforce"
    mid: "Feasible with caveats"
    high: "Operationally straightforward"
  socio_political:
    layer: Meta
    low: "Hostile climate (-1)"
    mid: "Neutral/mixed (0)"
    high: "Favorable climate (+1)"

interaction_guidance:
  modes:
    base: "Fixed I for comparability across cases."
    dynamic: "Default; dynamic I equals base (no hidden interaction logic)."
    override: "Use when precedent or socio-political signals are especially uncertain/strong."
  override_mode_defaults:
    override_mode: scale
    rationale: "Scale confidence without changing doctrine weights."
  dampen_when:
    precedent: "Precedent citations are cherry-picked or non-binding."
    socio_political: "Context is speculative or media-driven."
  amplify_when:
    black_letter: "Textual interpretation is strong and widely accepted."
    operational: "Implementation constraints are well-understood (agency guidance, enforcement history)."
  examples:
    - scenario: "Strong statutory text; precedent uncertain; political context noisy"
      interaction_mode: dynamic
      interaction_override: {black_letter: 1.2, precedent: 0.8, socio_political: 0.8}
      interaction_override_mode: scale
      rationale: "Lean on text; discount shaky precedent and noisy climate."

interpretation:
  high_m: "Friction: drift risk; strategy relying on precedent may be brittle."
  low_m: "Lower drift tension; precedent/text/operations/context are aligned."
  check:
    - "Text vs precedent gap often signals impending doctrinal pivot."
    - "Meta-level socio-political drift can dominate long-horizon outcomes."

iteration:
  note: "Coupling is based on L only; use I to encode confidence and compare m_score/attribution/visibility."

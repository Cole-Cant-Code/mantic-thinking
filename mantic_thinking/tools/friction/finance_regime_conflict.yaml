tool: finance_regime_conflict
type: friction
domain: finance

selection:
  use_when:
    - "Technical price action conflicts with macro/fundamentals or risk regime."
    - "Flows contradict price (accumulation/distribution vs tape)."
    - "Risk-off backdrop but bullish technicals (or vice versa)."
  not_for:
    - "Pure valuation questions without cross-signal inputs."
    - "Trade execution details (order types, broker mechanics)."

parameters:
  technical:
    layer: Micro
    low: "Bearish/weak tape"
    mid: "Choppy/indecisive"
    high: "Strong bullish technical structure"
  macro:
    layer: Macro
    low: "Macro headwinds"
    mid: "Mixed macro"
    high: "Macro tailwinds"
  flow:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Net outflows / selling pressure (-1)"
    mid: "Neutral / balanced (0)"
    high: "Net inflows / buying pressure (+1)"
  risk:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Risk-off / de-leveraging"
    mid: "Mixed risk appetite"
    high: "Risk-on / supportive liquidity"

interaction_guidance:
  modes:
    base: "Use fixed I for comparability across scenarios."
    dynamic: "Default; dynamic I equals base (no hidden interaction logic)."
    override: "Use to encode confidence in specific signals (e.g., unreliable flow proxy)."
  override_mode_defaults:
    override_mode: scale
    rationale: "Scale noisy signals down rather than rewriting the tool."
  dampen_when:
    technical: "Technical signal is distorted (illiquid, event-driven gap)."
    flow: "Flow proxy is indirect/lagging."
  amplify_when:
    macro: "Macro regime signal is robust (multiple indicators align)."
    risk: "Risk regime is clearly defined (vol + credit + liquidity agree)."
  examples:
    - scenario: "Illiquid tape makes technical noisy; macro/risk signals strong"
      interaction_mode: dynamic
      interaction_override: {technical: 0.7, macro: 1.2, risk: 1.2}
      interaction_override_mode: scale
      rationale: "Reduce micro noise; emphasize regime-level constraints."

interpretation:
  high_m: "Friction: regime conflict; be cautious with one-signal narratives."
  low_m: "Signals are broadly consistent; less regime conflict."
  check:
    - "Technical vs macro gap is a classic 'story vs tape' mismatch."
    - "Flow contradiction suggests hidden positioning or artificial support."

iteration:
  note: "Coupling is based on L only; use I to encode confidence and compare m_score/attribution changes."

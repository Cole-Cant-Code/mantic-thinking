tool: healthcare_phenotype_genotype
type: friction
domain: healthcare

selection:
  use_when:
    - "Genomic risk and clinical presentation appear misaligned (buffering or hidden burden)."
    - "High genetic risk but patient is doing unexpectedly well (resilience/protection hypothesis)."
    - "Low genetic risk but symptoms are severe (acute environment/stress hypothesis)."
  not_for:
    - "General health questions without quantified inputs or a risk-vs-symptom framing."
    - "Choosing specific medications or dosing."

parameters:
  phenotypic:
    layer: Micro
    low: "Minimal symptoms; vitals/labs stable"
    mid: "Moderate symptoms; mixed clinical picture"
    high: "Severe symptoms; clear clinical deterioration"
  genomic:
    layer: Micro
    low: "Low genetic risk; no strong variants"
    mid: "Moderate polygenic/variant risk"
    high: "High genetic risk; strong evidence of predisposition"
  environmental:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Low exposure burden; protective context"
    mid: "Mixed exposures; some risk factors present"
    high: "High exposure/toxic load; compounding risk factors"
  psychosocial:
    layer: Meso
    low: "High stress; poor support/adherence"
    mid: "Mixed coping; partial support"
    high: "Strong support; good adherence; high resilience"

interaction_guidance:
  modes:
    base: "Use fixed I=[1,1,1,1] for maximum comparability."
    dynamic: "Default; this tool's dynamic I equals base (no hidden interaction logic)."
    override: "Use to express confidence: dampen noisy layers; amplify trusted layers."
  override_mode_defaults:
    override_mode: scale
    rationale: "Scaling preserves the baseline score structure while adjusting confidence."
  dampen_when:
    phenotypic: "Symptoms are self-reported only; limited objective confirmation."
    genomic: "Genetic signal is uncertain/indirect for the condition." 
  amplify_when:
    phenotypic: "Multiple objective measures agree (labs + imaging + vitals)."
    psychosocial: "Support/adherence is strongly evidenced (stable routines, reliable caregiving)."
  examples:
    - scenario: "High genetic risk but symptom report is noisy; strong support system"
      interaction_mode: dynamic
      interaction_override: {phenotypic: 0.7, psychosocial: 1.2}
      interaction_override_mode: scale
      rationale: "Dampen noisy symptoms; amplify well-evidenced resilience/support."

interpretation:
  high_m: "Friction: mismatch between genetic risk and observed phenotype; investigate buffering vs hidden burden."
  low_m: "Alignment: clinical presentation matches genetic and context signals."
  check:
    - "If genomic high and phenotypic low: look for buffering (psychosocial/environmental protection)."
    - "If genomic low and phenotypic high: consider acute exposures, infection, or stressors."

iteration:
  note: "layer_coupling reflects L only; changing I will not change coupling. Use coupling to find disagreements, then tune inputs or I; compare m_score/attribution/visibility."

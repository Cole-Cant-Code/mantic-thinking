tool: social_narrative_rupture
type: friction
domain: social

selection:
  use_when:
    - "Virality/propagation is outpacing institutional response capacity."
    - "Counter-cultural narrative is spreading rapidly."
    - "Need to detect rupture timing (contained/ongoing/imminent)."
  not_for:
    - "General sentiment analysis without propagation/institution context."
    - "Choosing specific messaging copy."

parameters:
  individual:
    layer: Micro
    low: "Low individual-level activation"
    mid: "Moderate activation"
    high: "High activation/urgency"
  network:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Slow spread; weak bridging"
    mid: "Moderate propagation"
    high: "Rapid propagation"
  institutional:
    layer: Macro
    low: "High lag / low capacity"
    mid: "Mixed capacity"
    high: "Strong response capacity"
  cultural:
    layer: Meta
    low: "Counter-archetype / antagonistic (-1)"
    mid: "Neutral/mixed (0)"
    high: "Aligned with archetypes (+1)"

interaction_guidance:
  modes:
    base: "Fixed I for comparability across narratives."
    dynamic: "Default; dynamic I equals base (no hidden interaction logic)."
    override: "Use to encode confidence in measurement (platform metrics vs surveys)."
  override_mode_defaults:
    override_mode: scale
    rationale: "Scale confidence without changing narrative structure."
  dampen_when:
    individual: "Self-report/small sample; unclear representativeness."
    cultural: "Archetype framing is speculative."
  amplify_when:
    network: "Multiple platforms show consistent propagation patterns."
    institutional: "Institutional capacity measures are reliable (staffing, response times)."
  examples:
    - scenario: "Network metrics reliable; cultural framing uncertain"
      interaction_mode: dynamic
      interaction_override: {network: 1.2, cultural: 0.8}
      interaction_override_mode: scale
      rationale: "Trust propagation data; discount uncertain archetype claims."

interpretation:
  high_m: "Friction: rupture risk; response capacity mismatched to propagation speed."
  low_m: "Lower rupture tension; propagation and institutions are more balanced."
  check:
    - "High network + low institutional is the canonical rupture signature."

iteration:
  note: "Coupling is based on L only; use I to encode confidence and compare m_score/attribution/visibility."

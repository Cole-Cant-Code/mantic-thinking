tool: climate_resilience_multiplier
type: emergence
domain: climate

selection:
  use_when:
    - "You want interventions with multi-layer benefits (atmospheric + ecological + infrastructure + policy)."
    - "Seeking high-leverage funding priorities (multiplier effects)."
    - "Need to screen for cross-domain coupling strength."
  not_for:
    - "Single-metric climate accounting without intervention design."
    - "Local weather projection."

parameters:
  atmospheric_benefit:
    layer: Micro
    low: "Limited direct atmospheric benefit"
    mid: "Moderate benefit"
    high: "High benefit"
  ecological_benefit:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Weak ecosystem benefit"
    mid: "Mixed benefit"
    high: "Strong ecosystem benefit"
  infrastructure_benefit:
    layer: Macro
    low: "Weak resilience benefit"
    mid: "Moderate resilience"
    high: "Strong resilience benefit"
  policy_alignment:
    layer: Meta
    low: "Weak governance fit"
    mid: "Partial alignment"
    high: "Strong policy/legitimacy fit"

interaction_guidance:
  modes:
    base: "Fixed I for comparability."
    dynamic: "Default; dynamic I equals base (no hidden interaction logic)."
    override: "Use when evidence quality differs between benefits (e.g., infra benefits speculative)."
  override_mode_defaults:
    override_mode: scale
    rationale: "Scale confidence without changing theory weights."
  dampen_when:
    infrastructure_benefit: "Benefits rely on optimistic assumptions."
    policy_alignment: "Policy commitment is short-lived or unfunded."
  amplify_when:
    ecological_benefit: "Field evidence supports ecosystem outcomes."
    atmospheric_benefit: "Atmospheric impacts are validated across models/measurements."
  examples:
    - scenario: "Ecological benefits well-evidenced; infrastructure estimates uncertain"
      interaction_mode: dynamic
      interaction_override: {ecological_benefit: 1.2, infrastructure_benefit: 0.8}
      interaction_override_mode: scale
      rationale: "Trust ecology; discount speculative infra benefits."

interpretation:
  high_m: "Opportunity: multiplier intervention; prioritize."
  low_m: "Limited multiplier; consider alternatives or redesign."
  check:
    - "High coupling + high minimum layer supports strong multiplier classification."

iteration:
  note: "Coupling is based on L only; use I to encode confidence and compare m_score/attribution/visibility."

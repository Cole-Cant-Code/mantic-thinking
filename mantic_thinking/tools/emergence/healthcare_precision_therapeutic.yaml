selection:
  use_when:
    - "You suspect a rare high-alignment window for maximal therapeutic efficacy."
    - "All four factors (genomic readiness, environment, timing, engagement) may be simultaneously favorable."
    - "You want to identify the limiting factor blocking a favorable window."
  not_for:
    - "General medical questions without quantified readiness inputs."
    - "Selecting specific drugs or protocols."

parameters:
  genomic_predisposition:
    layer: Micro
    low: "Low biological readiness / weak responder likelihood"
    mid: "Partial readiness"
    high: "Strong biological readiness"
  environmental_readiness:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Environment not supportive (toxins, instability)"
    mid: "Mixed environment"
    high: "Supportive environment"
  phenotypic_timing:
    layer: Micro
    low: "Wrong stage/timing"
    mid: "Somewhat aligned"
    high: "Optimal stage/timing"
  psychosocial_engagement:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Low engagement/adherence"
    mid: "Mixed engagement"
    high: "High engagement/support"

interaction_guidance:
  modes:
    base: "Fixed I for comparability across patients/cohorts."
    dynamic: "Default; dynamic I equals base (no hidden interaction logic)."
    override: "Use to encode evidence quality per factor (e.g., timing poorly measured)."
  override_mode_defaults:
    override_mode: scale
    rationale: "Scale confidence; keep W immutable."
  dampen_when:
    phenotypic_timing: "Timing estimate is coarse (no staging, sparse data)."
    psychosocial_engagement: "Engagement claims are unverified."
  amplify_when:
    genomic_predisposition: "Genetic/biomarker evidence is strong and specific."
    environmental_readiness: "Environment measures are objective (exposure panels, stable housing)."
  examples:
    - scenario: "Timing uncertain, but biomarkers strong"
      interaction_mode: dynamic
      interaction_override: {phenotypic_timing: 0.8, genomic_predisposition: 1.2}
      interaction_override_mode: scale
      rationale: "Discount uncertain timing; emphasize strong biomarker readiness."

interpretation:
  high_m: "Opportunity: alignment window; act quickly while conditions hold."
  low_m: "No window: one or more factors are limiting; improve the weakest layer(s)."
  check:
    - "Limiting factor is typically the minimum layer value."

iteration:
  note: "Coupling is based on L only; use I to encode confidence and compare m_score/attribution/visibility."

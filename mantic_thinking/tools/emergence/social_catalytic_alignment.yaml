tool: social_catalytic_alignment
type: emergence
domain: social

selection:
  use_when:
    - "You suspect a movement-building window (readiness + bridges + policy + momentum)."
    - "Need to distinguish moderate vs transformative catalytic alignment."
    - "Planning mobilization timing and urgency."
  not_for:
    - "Choosing slogans/messaging without quantified alignment inputs."
    - "General cultural commentary without a mobilization objective."

parameters:
  individual_readiness:
    layer: Micro
    low: "Low readiness; apathy/fatigue"
    mid: "Mixed readiness"
    high: "High readiness; activation"
  network_bridges:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Siloed networks"
    mid: "Some bridging"
    high: "Strong cross-cutting bridges"
  policy_window:
    layer: Macro
    low: "Closed policy window"
    mid: "Partially open"
    high: "Open policy window"
  paradigm_momentum:
    layer: Meta
    low: "Paradigm stable"
    mid: "Shifting slowly"
    high: "Shift underway; momentum"

interaction_guidance:
  modes:
    base: "Use fixed I for comparability."
    dynamic: "Default; tool has minor dynamic interaction on network_bridges (preserves existing behavior)."
    override: "Use to encode confidence in measurement (bridging often proxy-based)."
  override_mode_defaults:
    override_mode: scale
    rationale: "Scaling preserves tool dynamics while expressing confidence."
  dampen_when:
    network_bridges: "Bridge metric is proxy-based or platform-specific."
    paradigm_momentum: "Momentum estimate is speculative."
  amplify_when:
    policy_window: "Policy window is verified (legislative calendar, sponsor commitments)."
    individual_readiness: "Readiness measured across multiple sources."
  examples:
    - scenario: "Policy window confirmed; network bridge metric uncertain"
      interaction_mode: dynamic
      interaction_override: {policy_window: 1.2, network_bridges: 0.8}
      interaction_override_mode: scale
      rationale: "Emphasize verified opportunity; discount noisy bridge proxy."

interpretation:
  high_m: "Opportunity: catalytic window; mobilize with urgency."
  low_m: "No window: build readiness/bridges or wait for policy opening."
  check:
    - "Transformative windows require both bridging and policy opening with momentum."

iteration:
  note: "Coupling is based on L only; use I/mode to encode confidence and compare m_score/attribution/visibility."

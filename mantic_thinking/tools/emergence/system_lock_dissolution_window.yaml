tool: system_lock_dissolution_window
type: emergence
domain: system_lock

selection:
  use_when:
    - "You suspect a lock-dissolution window may be forming."
    - "Alternative ecosystems are maturing while incumbent control weakens."
    - "You need timing guidance for structural vs competitive transition moves."
  not_for:
    - "Narrative-only commentary without measurable transition signals."
    - "Forecasting long-term collapse with no current convergence evidence."

parameters:
  autonomy_momentum:
    layer: Micro
    low: "Agency growth is stalled"
    mid: "Agency growth is visible but uneven"
    high: "Agency growth is strong and accelerating"
  alternative_readiness:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Alternatives are immature or fragmented"
    mid: "Alternatives are functional but not dominant"
    high: "Alternatives are viable and displacement-ready"
  control_vulnerability:
    layer: Macro
    low: "Incumbent control is stable"
    mid: "Incumbent control has visible stress points"
    high: "Control is fragile and exposed to displacement"
  pattern_flexibility:
    layer: Meta
    low: "System re-hardens quickly"
    mid: "Some adaptability; gains can hold with reinforcement"
    high: "Pattern rigidity is weakening; sustained change is plausible"

interaction_guidance:
  modes:
    base: "Use fixed I for comparability across phases."
    dynamic: "Default; alternative_readiness is boosted as control_vulnerability rises."
    override: "Use to encode confidence in readiness/vulnerability estimates."
  key_dynamic: "Vulnerability-driven readiness acceleration models competitive opening dynamics."

interpretation:
  high_m: "Opportunity: a dissolution window is forming or open; transition execution matters."
  low_m: "No dissolution window yet; continue capacity building and pressure alignment."
  check:
    - "Sustained windows require autonomy momentum, alternative readiness, and control vulnerability to converge."

iteration:
  note: "Use s_curve to test adoption onset and linear to test decay assumptions when comparing intervention timing."

tool: finance_confluence_alpha
type: emergence
domain: finance

selection:
  use_when:
    - "Technical setup aligns with macro tailwind and flow/risk conditions for asymmetric opportunity."
    - "You want to detect 'high conviction' windows when multiple signals converge."
    - "Flow is extreme (crowded) and may provide contrarian edge when aligned."
  not_for:
    - "Single-signal trade ideas without cross-factor inputs."
    - "Position sizing/execution mechanics."

parameters:
  technical_setup:
    layer: Micro
    low: "Poor structure; breakdown risk"
    mid: "Mixed setup"
    high: "Clean high-quality setup"
  macro_tailwind:
    layer: Macro
    low: "Macro headwind"
    mid: "Mixed macro"
    high: "Strong tailwind"
  flow_positioning:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Crowd/flows net short (-1)"
    mid: "Neutral (0)"
    high: "Crowd/flows net long (+1)"
  risk_compression:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Risk expanding; volatility rising"
    mid: "Mixed risk"
    high: "Risk compressed; supportive vol/liquidity"

interaction_guidance:
  modes:
    base: "Use I=[1,1,1,1] (no flow interaction boost)."
    dynamic: "Default; tool dynamically adjusts I based on flow extremes (preserves existing behavior)."
    override: "Use to encode confidence in flow proxy or macro regime call."
  override_mode_defaults:
    override_mode: scale
    rationale: "Scaling preserves dynamic behavior while expressing confidence."
  dampen_when:
    flow_positioning: "Flow proxy is indirect/lagging or estimated from weak data."
    macro_tailwind: "Macro interpretation is uncertain (mixed indicators)."
  amplify_when:
    technical_setup: "Setup is confirmed across timeframes."
    risk_compression: "Risk regime is clearly supportive (vol, credit, liquidity agree)."
  examples:
    - scenario: "Flow proxy noisy; technical/macro strong"
      interaction_mode: dynamic
      interaction_override: {flow_positioning: 0.8, technical_setup: 1.1}
      interaction_override_mode: scale
      rationale: "Reduce reliance on noisy flow; slightly emphasize validated setup."

interpretation:
  high_m: "Opportunity: confluence window; consider acting with defined risk."
  low_m: "No window: factors not aligned; wait or improve weakest factor."
  check:
    - "Switch interaction_mode to base to see sensitivity to tool dynamic interactions."

iteration:
  note: "Coupling is based on L only; use I/mode to encode confidence and compare m_score/attribution/visibility."

tool: military_strategic_initiative
type: emergence
domain: military

selection:
  use_when:
    - "You suspect a perishable initiative window for decisive action."
    - "Positional advantage is high and logistics/authorization are aligned."
    - "Enemy ambiguity creates exploitable uncertainty."
  not_for:
    - "Detailed operational planning or force design."
    - "Questions without quantified estimates."

parameters:
  enemy_ambiguity:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Enemy intent/capability is clear (low ambiguity)"
    mid: "Some ambiguity"
    high: "High ambiguity/fog"
  positional_advantage:
    layer: Micro
    low: "Weak position"
    mid: "Mixed position"
    high: "Strong positional edge"
  logistic_readiness:
    layer: Macro
    low: "Logistics not ready"
    mid: "Partial readiness"
    high: "Logistics ready"
  authorization_clarity:
    layer: Meta
    low: "Authorization unclear"
    mid: "Conditional"
    high: "Clear durable authorization"

interaction_guidance:
  modes:
    base: "Fixed I for comparability."
    dynamic: "Default; dynamic I equals base (no hidden interaction logic)."
    override: "Use to encode confidence (enemy ambiguity often uncertain)."
  override_mode_defaults:
    override_mode: scale
    rationale: "Scale confidence without changing domain weights."
  dampen_when:
    enemy_ambiguity: "Ambiguity estimate is guesswork."
    authorization_clarity: "Authorization is volatile."
  amplify_when:
    logistic_readiness: "Readiness is measured and current."
    positional_advantage: "Advantage is confirmed by ISR and terrain analysis."
  examples:
    - scenario: "Enemy ambiguity uncertain; logistics strong"
      interaction_mode: dynamic
      interaction_override: {enemy_ambiguity: 0.8, logistic_readiness: 1.2}
      interaction_override_mode: scale
      rationale: "Discount uncertain fog estimate; emphasize hard readiness."

interpretation:
  high_m: "Opportunity: initiative window; act within the perishable horizon."
  low_m: "No window: one or more factors limit initiative."
  check:
    - "Minimum floor across layers is often the gating constraint."

iteration:
  note: "Coupling is based on L only; use I to encode confidence and compare m_score/attribution/visibility."

tool: legal_precedent_seeding
type: emergence
domain: legal

selection:
  use_when:
    - "You suspect a window to set favorable precedent (ripeness + split + capacity)."
    - "Circuit split exists and socio-political climate may be receptive."
    - "Need a strategic read on timing/forum for a test case."
  not_for:
    - "Routine litigation tasks without systemic precedent objectives."
    - "Jurisdiction-specific legal advice without quantified inputs."

parameters:
  socio_political_climate:
    layer: Meta
    low: "Hostile climate (-1)"
    mid: "Neutral/mixed (0)"
    high: "Favorable climate (+1)"
  institutional_capacity:
    layer: Macro
    low: "Weak institutional readiness"
    mid: "Partial readiness"
    high: "Strong readiness/resources"
  statutory_ambiguity:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Text clear (little opening)"
    mid: "Some ambiguity"
    high: "High ambiguity/open doctrinal space"
  circuit_split:
    layer: Meso
    low: "No meaningful split"
    mid: "Emerging split"
    high: "Strong exploitable split"

interaction_guidance:
  modes:
    base: "Fixed I for comparability."
    dynamic: "Default; dynamic I equals base (no hidden interaction logic)."
    override: "Use when climate/split signals are uncertain or strongly evidenced."
  override_mode_defaults:
    override_mode: scale
    rationale: "Scale confidence without changing doctrinal weights."
  dampen_when:
    socio_political_climate: "Climate inference is speculative."
    circuit_split: "Split is overstated or based on weak precedent."
  amplify_when:
    statutory_ambiguity: "Ambiguity is well-grounded in text/history."
    institutional_capacity: "Capacity is demonstrated (resources, allies, procedural posture)."
  examples:
    - scenario: "Split strong; climate uncertain"
      interaction_mode: dynamic
      interaction_override: {circuit_split: 1.2, socio_political_climate: 0.8}
      interaction_override_mode: scale
      rationale: "Lean on hard doctrinal split; discount speculative climate read."

interpretation:
  high_m: "Opportunity: precedent window; pursue test case strategy."
  low_m: "No window: build split, improve capacity, or wait for climate shift."
  check:
    - "Windows often require both split strength and receptivity/capacity."

iteration:
  note: "Coupling is based on L only; use I to encode confidence and compare m_score/attribution/visibility."

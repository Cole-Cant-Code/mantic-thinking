tool: cyber_adversary_overreach
type: emergence
domain: cyber

selection:
  use_when:
    - "Attacker appears overextended while defender posture is hardened (defensive opportunity)."
    - "You want to detect a window for active defense/deception/takedown."
    - "Tool reuse fatigue plus geopolitical pressure suggests brittleness."
  not_for:
    - "Routine patching/vuln management without an attacker-overreach hypothesis."
    - "Attribution questions (use cyber_attribution_resolver)."

parameters:
  threat_intel_stretch:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Attacker appears stable; no stretch"
    mid: "Some stretch indicators"
    high: "Attacker stretched/thinly resourced"
  geopolitical_pressure:
    layer: Macro
    low: "Low pressure"
    mid: "Moderate pressure"
    high: "High pressure driving risky ops"
  operational_hardening:
    layer: Meso
    low: "Weak hardening"
    mid: "Partial hardening"
    high: "Strong detection/controls"
  tool_reuse_fatigue:
    layer: Micro
    low: "Fresh tooling; low reuse"
    mid: "Some reuse"
    high: "High reuse; signatures brittle"

interaction_guidance:
  modes:
    base: "Fixed I for consistent comparisons."
    dynamic: "Default; dynamic I equals base (no hidden interaction logic)."
    override: "Use to encode confidence in telemetry (tool reuse) vs strategic context."
  override_mode_defaults:
    override_mode: scale
    rationale: "Scale confidence; keep W immutable."
  dampen_when:
    geopolitical_pressure: "Pressure assessment is narrative-driven without evidence."
    threat_intel_stretch: "Stretch is inferred from weak intel."
  amplify_when:
    operational_hardening: "Hardening is confirmed by control coverage + recent tests."
    tool_reuse_fatigue: "Telemetry clearly shows reuse (hashes, infra, TTP repetition)."
  examples:
    - scenario: "Strong telemetry; geopolitical context uncertain"
      interaction_mode: dynamic
      interaction_override: {tool_reuse_fatigue: 1.2, geopolitical_pressure: 0.8}
      interaction_override_mode: scale
      rationale: "Emphasize evidence; discount speculative context."

interpretation:
  high_m: "Opportunity: attacker brittle while defender strong; consider action window."
  low_m: "No clear overreach window; continue monitoring/hardening."
  check:
    - "A window requires both attacker strain and defender hardening."

iteration:
  note: "Coupling is based on L only; use I to encode confidence and compare m_score/attribution/visibility."

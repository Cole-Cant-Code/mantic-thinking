# **Mantic Early Warning Tools**

## **Healthcare: Phenotype-Genotype Mismatch Detector**

Real-time patient dashboard cross-referencing Phenotypic symptoms (Micro-Meso) against Genomic risk profiles (Macro), Environmental exposures (Micro), and Psychosocial stressors (Meso), flagging when columns conflict (e.g., high Genomic risk + low Phenotypic presentation suggests Environmental buffering or Psychosocial resilience).

## **Finance: Regime Conflict Monitor**

Live cross-asset scanner tracking when Technical-Micro (price action) diverges from Macro-Macro (fundamental trend), Flow-Meso (positioning extremes), and Risk-Macro (systemic stress), alerting when 2+ columns contradict (e.g., "Breakout confirmed technically but Flow shows crowded long + Risk signals stress = false breakout probability").

## **Cybersecurity: Attribution Uncertainty Resolver**

Incident timeline tool mapping Technical IOCs (Micro) against Threat Intel TTPs (Meso), Operational business impact (Macro), and Geopolitical context (Meta), explicitly scoring cross-domain coupling strength (e.g., "Technical sophistication = High, but Geopolitical timing doesn't align with suspected actor = attribution confidence Low").

## **Climate: Maladaptation Preventer**

Infrastructure planning simulator running Atmospheric-Micro (weather events) against Infrastructure-Meso (building specs), Ecological-Macro (ecosystem services), and Policy-Meta (long-term targets), blocking proposals that solve Micro but worsen Macro (e.g., "AC expansion cools buildings but locks in carbon lock-in / grid stress").

## **Legal: Precedent Drift Alert**

Case strategy mapper tracking Black Letter-Micro (statute text) against Precedent-Meso (recent rulings), Operational-Macro (compliance feasibility), and Socio-Political-Meta (judicial philosophy trends), warning when Macro/Meta shifts threaten Meso assumptions (e.g., "Circuit precedent favorable, but Meta-Socio-Political shows textualist majority incoming = precedent vulnerability").

## **Military: Friction Forecast Engine**

Course-of-action analyzer scoring Maneuver-Meso (plan) against Intelligence-Meso (enemy assessment), Sustainment-Macro (logistics tail), and Political-Micro (ROE constraints), surfacing cross-domain bottlenecks (e.g., "Deep attack viable tactically, but Sustainment-Macro shows fuel exhaustion at D+3 and Political-Macro shows coalition fragility = operational risk Unacceptable").

## **Social/Cultural: Narrative Rupture Detector**

Viral moment tracker mapping Individual-Micro (sentiment signals) against Network-Meso (propagation topology), Institutional-Macro (response capacity), and Cultural-Meta (meaning-paradigm fit), flagging when Network-Meso amplification outpaces Institutional-Macro sense-making (e.g., "Meme spreading via Network bridges, but Cultural-Meta shows sincerity shift incoming = irony backlash risk").

## **System Lock: Recursive Control Detector**

Detects lock-in regimes where Agent Autonomy-Micro and Collective Capacity-Meso are suppressed while Concentration Control-Macro and Recursive Depth-Meta rise, signaling value asymmetry and intervention absorption (e.g., "Users can technically exit but defaults and recommendation loops keep behavior captive = active lock dynamics").

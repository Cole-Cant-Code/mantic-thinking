# Mantic Domain Config — System Lock

Use this domain when analyzing how concentrated control becomes self-reinforcing, and when those lock patterns begin to dissolve.

## Layer Translation

### Friction (`system_lock_recursive_control`)
- `agent_autonomy` (Micro): user agency, choice diversity, ability to exit defaults.
- `collective_capacity` (Meso): strength of coordinated alternatives and migration pathways.
- `concentration_control` (Macro): control concentration, extraction power, distribution gatekeeping.
- `recursive_depth` (Meta): how quickly interventions are absorbed into system-preserving behavior.

### Emergence (`system_lock_dissolution_window`)
- `autonomy_momentum` (Micro): agency growth trajectory.
- `alternative_readiness` (Meso): readiness of substitutes to absorb real usage.
- `control_vulnerability` (Macro): fragility in incumbent control.
- `pattern_flexibility` (Meta): ability of the system to avoid re-locking.

## Calibration Anchors

### Friction signatures
- Active lock-in: `[0.2, 0.3, 0.8, 0.7]`
- Intervention absorption: `[0.4, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8]`
- Pre-lock rigidity: `[0.5, 0.4, 0.6, 0.5]`

### Emergence signatures
- Redistribution window: `[0.6, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3]`
- Decentralization onset: `[0.5, 0.7, 0.5, 0.4]`
- Post-collapse redesign: `[0.4, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2]`

## Four-Phase Cycle

- Rigidity: concentration rises, alternatives weak, recursion still moderate.
- Breaking points: asymmetry becomes visible, coordination starts.
- Collapse/transition: incumbent vulnerabilities open transition windows.
- Restart: new structure forms and can trend toward re-concentration unless constrained.

## Historical Calibration Patterns

- Priesthoods -> platforms: interpretation monopoly -> algorithmic opacity.
- Feudalism -> ecosystems: labor dependency -> data/attention dependency.
- Banking opacity -> black-box services: delegated trust -> opaque extraction.

## Temporal Kernel Guidance

- `memory`: intervention absorption testing (persistence of lock effects).
- `s_curve`: transition/adoption onset (slow-then-sudden alternative uptake).
- `linear`: planned decay modeling for lock dissolution trajectories.

Note: `system_lock` allows only `linear`, `memory`, and `s_curve` kernels in this runtime.
